# My end-of-quarter reflection

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
* Arithmetic operators - These include + for addition, * for multiplication, / for division, and etc. In my opinion they are all relatively simple and intuitive even if this is my first time learning about this.
* Output statements(?) - These include console.log, alert, and etc. console.log is used for debugging codes where the output will not be displayed in the actual website but the terminal and such. alert, on the other hand, 

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
* Loops - I know what loops are and how they work but I'm not sure that I understand how to apply loops to create things, especially if it gets too complex :(
* && and || - Again, I know what they are but when I'm asked to look at a statement including these and there are too many things that I need to evaluate and consider, my mind kind of blanks?
* Functions - I know what and how to make functions but I still can't fully grasp how to use them or what to do with them, if that makes sense...? But I think all I need for this is further practice.
* Operations - Operations on their own I can understand, but I think I need to further familiarize myself with the other and what comes first when they're all together. I already mostly understand these, though.
* Nested loops - I get the concept but when it comes to applying them, I really think that I need more practice to familiarize myself with the order or just to master it.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
I plan to have a consult with Sir Roy about the topics that I don't really understand yet before we start with the next topics so that I can really focus during the next discussions. I also want to give more time for CS than I allowed this quarter. I need to lock in and really practice what I need to practice instead of just doing CS work if it's graded or required or during CS time.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
Two activities that I believe were effective to deepen my understanding about the lesson was the activity where we had to write code on a piece of paper instead of on the computers and also the activities that required us to work in groups or pairs, I think that both of these helped me understand whatever topic was being taught to us like loops and etc, and working with other people is a lot easier than doing things on my own. Two activities that I think were not that effective, on the other hand, would be some of the graded exercises, because SOME of them were just very complicated and takes me so long to do and understand and I believe that this doesn't really help me especially if I just end up trying things until it works without really understanding what I'm doing, it's really just a me problem...!!!
